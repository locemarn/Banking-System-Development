# Banking System Development - Complete Project Guide

A comprehensive guide to building a production-ready banking system from a simple monolith to an enterprise-grade modular platform. This project demonstrates modern software architecture patterns, security implementations, and operational excellence for financial services.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Overview

This banking system development project takes you through four progressive phases, each building upon the previous one to create a fully functional, production-ready banking platform. Starting with basic account and transaction functionality, the project evolves into a sophisticated system capable of handling real-world banking operations with enterprise-grade security and compliance.

### Key Technologies
